# TIL: What is a component and how does it work
_25-11-2024_

A `component` is:

- A minimum logical unit 🟧
- A function that gets executed ⚙️ and its result is rendered.
- It should only contain the logic 📐 it belongs to. _(single responsabilty principle vibes? 🤔)_

>[!NOTE]
> Each component always returns HTML-like code (JSX).

For that reason, you can add millions of dashboards if you wish 🤡. 
Each of them is a different instance, __since the same function is executed multiple times.__

---
Your job will be to minimize the number of these renderings
