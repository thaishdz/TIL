## What I Learned :LiGlasses:
---
The bundling process has 3 parts:

- **Minified** - The code is compressed into a smaller version to reduce file size. This removes blank spaces, comments and code non essencial

- **Uglified** (ofuscación) - The code is transformed into a single line, making it harder to read and understand for hackers hehe.

	- For example : It converts `price` into `a1b2c3`

- **Tree Shaking** - Removes unused code and files during the bundling process.”

## Notes and Reflections :LiPencil:
---
The bundling process is great for optimizing web performance and makes life harder for hackers, although they can decompile it using their hacking tools :LiThumbsUp:
